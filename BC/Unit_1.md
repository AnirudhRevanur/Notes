# Blockchain

- It is a technology that:
  - Permits transactions to be gathered into blocks and recorded
  - Cryptographically chains blocks together
  - Allows the resulting ledger to be accessed by all servers
- Removes the centralization of environment
- Everyone makes their own copy, network worries about consistency
- It is a decentralized system
- It is an "Open, Distributed Ledger" that can record transactions between two parties in a Verifiable and Permanent way
- **_Open_**: Accessible to All
- **_Distributed_**: No single control Party
- **_Verifiable_**: Everyone can check the validity of the information
- **_Permanent_**: Information is persistent
- Bitcoin is the first use case for Blockchain

## Public Ledger

- Every node maintains a local copy of the global data sheet
- System ensures consistency among local copies
- Local copy at every node is identical
- Local copies are always updated based on the global information

## Key Features

- Anonymity
- Immutability
- Transparency
- Peer to Peer
- Distributed
- Logical Computation

## Nodes

- If a computer connects to a network, it becomes a node

### Level of Participation

#### Full Node

- Downloads all the blocks and transactions to its local storage
- Is fully independent on node on a blockchain networks
- Can provide blocks and transactions to other nodes
- Can get new blocks
- Can verify all the blocks

#### Light Node

- Has block headers and some transactions
- Has public/private key pair
- Uses SPV to verify transactions

#### Miner Node

- Helps in creating blocks for a blockchain networks
- Full Node with Full Node Software
- Takes a lot of CPU and GPU Power

### Type of network

#### Public Nodes

- Open for anyone in the world
- Any node can be a full node, light node or a miner
- No gating
- No permission
- No fees required

#### Permissioned Nodes

- Know the entities
- No native cryptocurrency
- Most do not incorporate mining

#### Federated Nodes

- Factom and Waves

## Cryptocurrency

- Type of digital cash and it is a bearer instrument
- Satashi Nakamoto started idea with Bitcoin
- 2009 was when the Genesis Block was launched
- Bitcoin is 33L INR

### Bitcoin Cash

- Cryptocurrency split into two cryptocurrencies
- Bcash and Bitcoin SV
- Symbol is BCH

### Monero

- Open source cryptocurrency started in 2014
- Was called BitMonero
- CryptoNight hash function

### Dash

- Open source cryptocurrency
- Written in C++
- Was called Darkcoin

### Dogecoin

- Is a meme coin
- Scrypt-based hash function
- Written in C++

## Advantages of Cryptocurrency

- Protection from inflation
- Self-governed and maintained
- Secure and private
- Currency exchange is easy
- Cost-effective mode of transaction
- Fast way to transfer funds

## Disadvantages

- Can be used for illegal transaction
- Data loss === Financial Loss
- Decentralized, but still run by some system
- Hacks
- Mining can cause environment changes
- No refund

## Digital Asset

- Non tangible Asset
- Digital Form
- Coins and tokens are utilizing cryptography
- Coins and tokens are using cryptography
- A token cannot be made into a coin directly

|                         Coin                          |                        Token                         |
| :---------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------: |
| Coin is digital currency similar to physical currency |          Digital asset issued on a project           |
| Coin operates its own blockchain with its own protocl |        Does not operate on its own blockchain        |
|          Purely used as a source of payment           | Used for payments and for signing digital agreements |
|              Public Blockchain networks               |             Public and Private Networks              |
|              Created by a smart contract              |           Generated by consensus algorithm           |
|             Created for a special purpose             |                  Given as a reward                   |

### Token

- It is a digital asset
- Programmable assets or rights
- Managed by a smart contract
- Underlying distributed ledger
- Rise to a lot of decentralized applications and Decentralized Autonomous Organization

#### Types of tokens

- Utility
- Security
- Governance
- Transactional
- Platform
- NFTs

- **_ERC-20_**
  - It is on the Ethereum Network
  - Used for crowdfunding
- **_ERC-721_**
  - Digital collectibles
  - Implemented in cryptokitties
- **_ERC 1411_**
  - Is a security token

#### Features

- Represent a set of rules encoded in a smart contract
- Every token belongs to s blockchain domain
- Accessible with a digital wallet
- Communication wrt token is only through public=private key pair related to blockchain address
- Only the person that has private key for that domain can access the respective tokens

## Ledger

- Database
- Confirmed transactions are recorded
- Not a collection of asset
- Immutable
- **_Centralised_** &rarr; One node/third party maintains it
- **_Public_** &rarr; Every node has a copy of it
