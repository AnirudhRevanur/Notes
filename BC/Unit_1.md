# Blockchain

- It is a technology that:
  - Permits transactions to be gathered into blocks and recorded
  - Cryptographically chains blocks together
  - Allows the resulting ledger to be accessed by all servers
- Removes the centralization of environment
- Everyone makes their own copy, network worries about consistency
- It is a decentralized system
- It is an "Open, Distributed Ledger" that can record transactions between two parties in a Verifiable and Permanent way
- **_Open_**: Accessible to All
- **_Distributed_**: No single control Party
- **_Verifiable_**: Everyone can check the validity of the information
- **_Permanent_**: Information is persistent
- Bitcoin is the first use case for Blockchain

## Public Ledger

- Every node maintains a local copy of the global data sheet
- System ensures consistency among local copies
- Local copy at every node is identical
- Local copies are always updated based on the global information

## Key Features

- Anonymity
- Immutability
- Transparency
- Peer to Peer
- Distributed
- Logical Computation

## Nodes

- If a computer connects to a network, it becomes a node

### Level of Participation

#### Full Node

- Downloads all the blocks and transactions to its local storage
- Is fully independent on node on a blockchain networks
- Can provide blocks and transactions to other nodes
- Can get new blocks
- Can verify all the blocks

#### Light Node

- Has block headers and some transactions
- Has public/private key pair
- Uses SPV to verify transactions

#### Miner Node

- Helps in creating blocks for a blockchain networks
- Full Node with Full Node Software
- Takes a lot of CPU and GPU Power

### Type of network

#### Public Nodes

- Open for anyone in the world
- Any node can be a full node, light node or a miner
- No gating
- No permission
- No fees required

#### Permissioned Nodes

- Know the entities
- No native cryptocurrency
- Most do not incorporate mining

#### Federated Nodes

- Factom and Waves

## Cryptocurrency

- Type of digital cash and it is a bearer instrument
- Satashi Nakamoto started idea with Bitcoin
- 2009 was when the Genesis Block was launched
- Bitcoin is 33L INR

### Bitcoin Cash

- Cryptocurrency split into two cryptocurrencies
- Bcash and Bitcoin SV
- Symbol is BCH

### Monero

- Open source cryptocurrency started in 2014
- Was called BitMonero
- CryptoNight hash function

### Dash

- Open source cryptocurrency

- Secure and private
- Currency exchange is easy
- Cost-effective mode of transaction
- Fast way to transfer funds

## Disadvantages

- Can be used for illegal transaction
- Data loss === Financial Loss
- Decentralized, but still run by some system
- Hacks
- Mining can cause environment changes
- No refund

## Digital Asset

- Non tangible Asset
- Digital Form
- Coins and tokens are utilizing cryptography
- Coins and tokens are using cryptography
- A token cannot be made into a coin directly

| :---------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------: |
| Coin is digital currency similar to physical currency |          Digital asset issued on a project           |
| Coin operates its own blockchain with its own protocl |        Does not operate on its own blockchain        |
|          Purely used as a source of payment           | Used for payments and for signing digital agreements |
|              Public Blockchain networks               |             Public and Private Networks              |
|              Created by a smart contract              |           Generated by consensus algorithm           |
|             Created for a special purpose             |                  Given as a reward                   |

### Token

- It is a digital asset
- Programmable assets or rights
- Managed by a smart contract
- Underlying distributed ledger
- Rise to a lot of decentralized applications and Decentralized Autonomous Organization

#### Types of tokens

- Utility
- Security
- Governance
- Transactional
- Platform
- NFTs

- **_ERC-20_**
  - It is on the Ethereum Network
  - Used for crowdfunding
- **_ERC-721_**
  - Digital collectibles
  - Implemented in cryptokitties
- **_ERC 1411_**
  - Is a security token

#### Features

- Represent a set of rules encoded in a smart contract
- Every token belongs to s blockchain domain
- Accessible with a digital wallet
- Communication wrt token is only through public=private key pair related to blockchain address
- Only the person that has private key for that domain can access the respective tokens

## Ledger

- Database
- Confirmed transactions are recorded
- Not a collection of asset
- Immutable
- **_Centralised_** &rarr; One node/third party maintains it
- **_Public_** &rarr; Every node has a copy of it

### Public Ledger

- Organizes into a long chain of blocks of information
- Distributed ledger is a database that is consensually shared and synced across multiple sites, institutions, geographies, and is accessible by multiple people
- Distributed ledger stands in contrast to a centralised ledger, which most companies use

### Features

- Synchronized and accessible across different systems
- Replace the need for a central authority
- Cyber attacks and financial fraud are reduced

### Transaction

1. Current condition
2. Transaction happens
3. Approval of transaction chain

### Advantages

- Reduce operational inefficiencies
- Speed up the amount of time a transaction takes to complete
- Redice overall costs for entities
- Easy flow of information
- Easy to follow for accountants
- Remove the possibility of fraud occuring on the financial books of a company

## Peer-to-Peer

- Decentralised network communications model
- Consists of a group of devices that collectively store and share files
- Communication is done without any central administrator

### Role of P2P

- P2P is a technology utilizing concept of decentralization
- Allows all cryptocurrencies to be shared around the world
- Decentralized ledger tracking one or more digital assets
- Decentralized network, computers are connected in some way, each maintains a copy of the ledger, compares it to other devices to ensure data is accurate

### Pros

- Highly available
- Greater security
- No third party trys
- Cannot be censored by central authorities
- Virtually immune to DoS attacks
- P2P when paired with majority consensus gives blockchains a relatively high degree of resistance to malicious activites

### Cons

- Need high compute power
- Reduces efficiency
- Main hindrances in terms of scalability and mass adoption

## Types of Blockchains

### Public

- Permissionless blockchains
- Anyone can join the network, read and write to ledger
- Any user can develop and add smart contracts
- Complete decentralization
- Users are anonymous in the network
- Issue of digital currency

#### Advantages

- More secure
- More Decentralised
- Self governed
- User empowerment

#### Disadvantages

- High transaction time (~10 minutes for Bitcoin)
- High compute power
- Less privacy
- Identity unrecognized

### Private

- Permissioned Blockchain Network
- Controlled by a single organization
- Do not let any user to freely join
- User's identity is known to everyone
- Transactions are visible to only those who have permission
- Maintains an access control mechanism
- Not fully decentralized
- Organizations that want control over their data
- Hyperledger Fabric and Corda

#### Advantages

- Full privacy
- More efficient
- Resource saving
- Regulated network
- Empowering organization

#### Disadvantages

- Partial decentralization

#### Companies

- Walmart has developed on Hyperledger Fabric
- Comcast has partnered and launched Blockgraph
- BurstIQ's big data blockchain helps patients and doctors securely transger medical information
- Spotify acquired Mediachain

### Consortium

- Also called as Federated Blockchain
- Permissioned Blockchain
- Governed by a group of organizations
- More decentralized than private network
- Setting up is pain
- No superior access
- Identity is known

#### Advantages

- Saves cost
- Risk sharing
- Gradual mass adoption

### Hybrid Blockchain

- Blend of public and private blockchain
- Provide controlled access and freedom at the same time
- Participant has decision authority
- Auth is required for entry in the ecosystem
- Anonymous entity
- Supply chain, banking, Government process
- Ex: Dragonchain

#### Advantages

- Offers Privacy
- Good scalability
- Rule modification allowed

## Block Structure

- Block Header is used to identify a particular block on an entire blockchain
- Header contains:
  - Version
  - Time
  - Difficulty
  - Prev Hash
  - Nonce
  - Merkle Root

## Transaction

- When two parties exchange something
- Better and safer ways to transcat with one another
