# Design Patterns

- Used to represent some of the best practices adapted by experienced OO software devs
- Premade blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurrinf design problem in your code

1. Reusable solutions to the problems
2. Interaction between objects
3. Template, not a solution
4. Language Independent

## Essential Elements

- Pattern Name
- Problem solving
- Solutino
- Consequences

## Pros

- Add consistency to designs by solving similar problems in the same way
- Add clarity to design and design communication
- Improve time to solution by providing templates
- Rese through composition

## Cons

- Some patterns come with negative consequences
- Patterns are subject to different interpretations, misinterpretations and philosophies
- They can be overused and become Anti-Patterns

# Anti-Patterns

- Literary form that describes a commonly occuring solution to a problem that generates decidedly negative consequences
- May be the result of a manager or developer not knowing any better, or enough experience in solving this pattern, or using a good pattern in wrong time
- Solution that is recognized as a poor way to solve the problem and refactored solution
- Three major viewpoints

## Development Anti-Patterns

- Situations encountered by the programmer when solving programming problems

## Architectural Anti-Patterns

- Focus on common problems in system structure
- Many of the unresolved problems in software systems occur from this perspective

## Management Anti-Patterns

- Common problems and solutions due to the software organization
- It affects people in all software roles, and solution directly affect technical success of project

## Root Causes

- Based on the seven deadly sins
- **_Haste:_** Tight deadlines leading to neglecting imortant activities
- **_Apathy:_** The attitude of not caring about solving known problems
- **_Narrow Mindedness:_** Refusal of devs to learn proven solution
- **_Sloth:_** Adaptation of the most simple "solution"
- **_Avarice:_** Greed in creating a system can result in very complex and difficult to manage software
- **_Ignorance:_** Lack of motivation to understand things
- **_Pride:_** Failure to reuse existing software packages because they were not invented by a specific company
