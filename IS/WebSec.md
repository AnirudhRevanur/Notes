# Web Security

- Primary function of a web server is to deliver web content
- Web server is stateless
- Cookies are used to save info client side
- Set-Cookie allows to set a new cookie
- Cookies can track users
- Use InPrivate Mode when browsing
- Block third party cookies => Used for advertisements
- Sandbox JavaScript
- Communication Mechanisms
  - Normal HTTP
  - Ajax
  - WebSocket
- Ajax => Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
- Ajax is slowly being replaced by Fetch API
- Only responses from the same web server can be given to the callback function, if it is not same, then Cross Origin Request Block
- Request sent, Response came back, but Browser blocks Ajax from accessing response
- Cross Origin compromise privacy
- CORS was created => Cross Origin Resource Sharing
- Ajax uses HTTP => Half duplex
- WebSocket is full duplex
